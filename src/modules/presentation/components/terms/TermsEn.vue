      <h3>9.2. INTERNET TAGS</h3>
      <p>
        https://miimber.com may occasionally use Internet tags (also known as
        "tags", or action tags, single-pixel GIFs, transparent GIFs, invisible
        GIFs, and one-to-one GIFs) and deploy them through a web analytics
        partner that may be located (and thus store corresponding information,
        including the User's IP address) in a foreign country.
      </p>
      <p>
        These tags are placed both in online advertisements allowing Internet
        users to access the Site, and on the various pages of the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        This technology enables https://miimber.com to evaluate the responses of
        visitors to the Site and the effectiveness of its actions (for example,
        the number of times a page is opened and the information consulted), as
        well as the use of this Site by the User.
      </p>
      <p>
        The external service provider may collect information about visitors to
        the Site and other websites using these tags, compile reports on Site
